# Library CMD & Powershell bypass ATX
*Educational Purposes Only.*

A CMD & Powershell workaround to the computers at the Central Library of Downtown ATX.

## What This Does

The computers at the Austin Central Library block a number of things at a surface level.. *powershell.exe*, *taskmgr.exe*, *eventvwr.exe (the security tab)*, *cmd.exe*, *regedit.exe* for obvious reasons, but I wanted to see if I could work around this.. so I made this project to document my findings, I also built a custom cmd prompt and script to streamline the process.

## Getting Started

- Install Python [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
